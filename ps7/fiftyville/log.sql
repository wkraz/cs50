-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
-- I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.                                                                                                 |
-- As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
-- In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
